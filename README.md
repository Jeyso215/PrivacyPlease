**Privacy Please** is a browser extension that automatically redirects users from major websites to privacy-respecting frontend alternatives. Instead of feeding surveillance capitalism, you get clean access to content without tracking, ads, or engagement profiling.

## 🔒 What It Does

When you navigate to sites like YouTube, Reddit, Twitter/X, or Google, the extension intercepts the request and redirects you to an open-source frontend. Same content, zero tracking.

Examples:
- YouTube → Invidious
- Twitter/X → Nitter
- Reddit → RedLib
- Google Search → SearXNG
- TikTok → ProxiTok

The extension supports multiple frontends for each service. You can pick your preferred instance or disable redirection for specific platforms entirely.

## 🛡️ Why This Matters

Most modern websites aren't just content platforms — they’re surveillance machines. Even without logging in, you’re being profiled. This extension bypasses the platform’s frontend entirely, reducing your exposure to:

- Tracking cookies
- Behavioral analytics
- Fingerprinting
- Ad targeting
- UI dark patterns

Instead of patching the surveillance model, this extension replaces it at the source.
